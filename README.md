# Hello website!
 This is a weather api app. API is referencing this website: https://openweathermap.org/

## What's in this project?

← `README.md`: DEscription

← `index.html`: The HTML defines the structure and content of the page.

← `style.css`: The CSS applies styles to the elements in your HTML page.

← `script.js`: Interactivity with JavaScript. The code in the JavaScript file runs when the page loads, and uses API to obtain weather information.

Open each file and check out the comments (in gray) for more info.
